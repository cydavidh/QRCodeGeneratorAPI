QRCodeGeneratorAPI is a Spring Boot application that provides a RESTful API for creating QR codes. Users can specify the content, size, error correction level (L, M, Q, H), and image type (PNG, JPEG, GIF) for the generated QR code. I used the Zebra Crossing library for QR code generation and Spring Boot for API development, practicing integrating third-party libraries into a Spring application.
